Create a blink program for Raspberry Pico 2 (RP2350) based on the newest versions of Pico C-SDK (2.1.1) and FreeRTOS (11.1.0).
The idea is to give a simple way to build a working application with the newest Pico-SDK/FreeRTOS Versions (end of March 2025), especially the way how to install FreeRTOS11.1.0 under Pico-SDK2.1.1
